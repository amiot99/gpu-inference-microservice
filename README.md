GPU Inference Microservice with FastAPI + PyTorch

This project is a minimal, production-style microservice that performs GPU-accelerated image classification using a pre-trained ResNet18 model from PyTorch. 
The service is built with FastAPI, and is ready to be containerized, deployed, and extended.
